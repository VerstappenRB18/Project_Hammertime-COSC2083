    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <p>Almost all of the software and tools used in this project are new to us as we are first-year students, 
    but that excites us as we are eager to learn and implement these technologies in the near future.</p>
    <p>The most important software that we used is Visual Studio Code (version 1.74.1) , 
    which is the IDE that we used to code and edit our website, 
    the software is free to use and is widely regarded to be the industry standard for coding all languages.</p>
    <p>For collaboration, we used GitHub to host our repository and our website, which enables us to work together on the same project at different times. </p>
    <p>We also used GitHub desktop (version 3.1.2) as an interface that lets us easily clone the repository and work on the project locally on our own desktop.</p> 
    <p>The Canva platform was also used to create early design drafts of what we wanted our app to look like. 
    Members Gia Bao and Minh Hoang specifically had experiences using this software in high school for their respective projects.</p>
    <p>Assetto Corsa [18](version 1.16) was used to create the reference lap to showcase to the end user. 
    Gia Bao and Huu Luan have had previous experiences using this application before and know the software well.</p>
    <p>The Auto-Data.net API [4] is used as the main database for cars for our app. 
    It contains an extensive amount of over 46000 separate detailed automotive technical specifications, more than 3000 car models and over 8400 generations.
    This data is licensed and costs 75$ to use.</p>
    <p>To display the desired racing track and put out the reference lap, the group collects and uses data from the website racingcircuits.info [5], 
    as it contains useful information about the racing track, from the history of itself, 
    to the circuit map and onboard videos of various drivers driving around the circuit.</p>
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>Testing the app on a real track from the database is a critical step in establishing whether the app will assist increase lap time. 
    It is critical to test the app on a track similar to the one on which the user will be racing, as this will provide the most accurate results.</p>
    <p>To start our testing process, we will need to find people who are interested in racing and have already familiarized themself 
    with the basic concepts of track racing and what to do. 
    Setting up the track is the next step in testing the program. 
    This includes determining the layout of the track, the number of laps, and any other specifications that may be required. 
    Once the track is set up, the user can then begin testing the app. 
    To begin, the user needs to run a few laps without the app to establish a baseline lap time. 
    This will offer the user an estimate of how fast they can go without using the app.</p>
    <p>After that, the user can begin testing the software. The user should run a few laps with the app active.
    This will show the user how much the app is assisting them in improving their lap time. 
    The user should also keep track of any modifications in their driving style that the app may suggest.</p>
    <p>After testing the app on the track, the user can compare their lap times with and without the app.
    This gives the user an excellent idea of how much the program is assisting them in improving their lap time. 
    If the software is assisting them in improving their lap time, they can continue to use the app to increase their performance.</p>
    <p>Overall, testing the app on a real track from the database is a critical step in deciding whether the software will help improve lap time. 
    Running a few laps with and without the app can provide a decent indicator of how much the software is assisting the user in improving their lap time.
    If the software is assisting in improving lap time, that means our app is working as intended</p>
    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <h4>1. 	Technical dangers</h4>
    <p>There are a variety of danger considerations to take into account because HammerTime has so many functions. 
    The following list of potential mistakes has a high likelihood of occurring:</p>
    <h4>Unreliable driver input</h4>
    <p>It's possible that the driver entered the incorrect data because they lack expertise and don't understand what understeer and oversteer are. 
    The method employed to distinguish shifts also makes it susceptible to noise pollution from the driver, other passengers, or outside sources. 
    Additionally, depending on where the track is, the GPS utilized for speed estimation may not be accurate. 
    HammerTime won't be able to provide the driver with pertinent feedback as a result of all these elements taken together.</p>
    <p>It's unfortunate that we have to live with this flaw because we wanted to make the app as user-friendly as possible by utilizing readily available sensors on your phone, 
    such as the microphone to distinguish shifts and GPS to estimate speed. 
    That being said, some solutions that can be looked into include an AI for noise cancellation and it can filter out just the specific frequencies of the upshifts and downshifts.</p>
    <h4>Erroneous track layout</h4>
    <p>Due to improvements that cannot be seen with the human eye (such as the track modifications at the Circuit de Monaco) [21], 
    given the size of the racing circuits database, the application may experience track layout issues. 
    Unexpected lap times could result from an inaccurate track layout.</p>
    <p>Possible solutions include updating the database frequently, 
    checking the layout for errors whenever a change is announced, and making sure the database is updated to reflect the change.</p>
    <h4>Erroneous track facts</h4>
    <p>Given the abundance of reports on various racing circuits, the likelihood of inaccurate track information 
    and recorded lap times in the database may have an impact on the app's output accuracy, 
    leading to user confusion and a potential for unexpected results.</p>
    <h4>Improperly detects certain sorts of corners.</h4>
    <p>Due to the similarities between the bends on race circuits, it is likely that the program will incorrectly identify the corners. 
    The way users or drivers use the brake and throttle when performing a flying lap may have an impact on the false detection.
    To produce desired outcomes, numerous testing instances are required.</p>
    <p>Potential remedies: It is necessary to improve machine learning and add more patterns for it to recognize, 
    such as corner characteristics and how drivers typically handle different types of bends with things like throttle input and steering angle.</p>
    <h4>User enters the wrong vehicle's manufacturer and model</h4>
    <p>There is a small chance that a user will enter the incorrect configuration of their car into the app, 
    confusing the program into simulating the incorrect reference lap for the user to watch and for the app to provide feedback. 
    This is due to the large number of cars and their make and model even having minor variations.</p>
    <p>Future databases may be used to solve this problem by forcing users to enter their car's VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), 
    however this method is less user-friendly and can be annoying.</p>
    <h4>Due to track conditions, it may occasionally be impossible to follow the reference lap.</h4>
    <p>It could be challenging for the software to recreate an exact reference lap due to the variety of data that needs to be processed, 
    such as the track and weather conditions of the real-world track and weather conditions.</p>
    <p>Possible solutions: Additional work may be needed to import weather conditions into the app and the simulator; however, only specific conditions, 
    such as light showers or soaking wet,
    can be imported at this time because it will take a long time to implement the ability to accurately capture temperatures and the amount of rain.</p>
    <h4>II. Other dangers</h4>
    <p>In addition to hazards associated with the app, there are other dangers, such as those caused by human mistake.</p>
